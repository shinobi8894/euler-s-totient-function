What's Euler's Totient Function
```
풙(1) = 1  
gcd(1, 1) is 1

풙(2) = 1
gcd(1, 2) is 1, but gcd(2, 2) is 2.

풙(3) = 2
gcd(1, 3) is 1 and gcd(2, 3) is 1

풙(4) = 2
gcd(1, 4) is 1 and gcd(3, 4) is 1

풙(5) = 4
gcd(1, 5) is 1, gcd(2, 5) is 1, 
gcd(3, 5) is 1 and gcd(4, 5) is 1

풙(6) = 2
gcd(1, 6) is 1 and gcd(5, 6) is 1,
